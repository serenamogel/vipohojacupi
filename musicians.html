LL Cool J signed to fledgling hip-hop label Def Jam Records in 1984. After a string of hits—included on albums like Bigger and Deffer, Walking with a Panther, Mama Said Knock You Out, 14 Shots to the Dome and Mr. Smith—LL turned to acting, appearing in movies like B.A.P.S., Halloween H2O and Any Given Sunday. In 2009, he began his run on the popular investigative series NCIS: Los Angeles.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">LL Cool J was born James Todd Smith on January 14, 1968, in Bay Shore, Long Island, New York. Growing up in New York City, Smith adopted the stage name LL Cool J, which stands for "Ladies Love Cool James." The outgoing teen signed to Def Jam records in 1984, which was a fledgling rap label at the time, founded by Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin. LL released the hit "I Need a Beat" soon after, which sold more than 100,000 copies.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Music and Acting Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The young artist left school to record his debut album, Radio, which was a hugely successful mix of conventional song structure and pop-oriented rap. Music fans responded enthusiastically to the album's singles, "I Can't Live Without My Radio" and "Rock the Bells," and bought more than 1 million copies of the recording. He appeared as himself in the feature film Krush Groove (1985) around this time, which was a fictionalized version of the early days of Def Jam. The members of Run-D.M.C., Fat Boys and New Edition also appeared in the film. His first speaking role was a small part in the 1986 high school football comedy, Wildcats.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In his follow-up album, 1987's Bigger and Deffer, LL Cool J showed his softer side with the popular ballad, "I Need Love." The song became a hit on both the rap and pop charts. Two years later, he was back on the charts with his album Walking with a Panther.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It was his fourth album, Mama Said Knock You Out (1990), however, that became his biggest seller to date. Projecting a tougher, more "street" persona, LL Cool J won over new fans with the title track. The single was as popular in middle America as it was in the urban environs of his youth. For the song, LL won his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance. The album also featured the successful ballad "Around the Way Girl" and the straight-forward rap "The Boomin' System."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After stumbling with 1993's "gangsta" style 14 Shots to the Dome, LL Cool J played up his sexy image with 1995's Mr. Smith. The explicit single "Doin' It" featured a duet with rapper LeShaun. Another hit from the album, the romantic slow jam "Hey Lover" won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the late 1990s, LL Cool J had officially crossed over to a career as a legitimate actor. He appeared in the 1997 comedy B.A.P.S., starring Halle Berry and directed by Robert Townsend, and the 1998 horror flick Halloween H2O, with Jamie Lee Curtis. In 1999's Any Given Sunday, LL showed off his acting chops, taking on a supporting role across from such heavy-hitting stars as Al Pacino, Dennis Quaid, Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx. He starred the crime drama In Too Deep with Omar Epps and Samuel L. Jackson that same year. Also around this time, LL Cool J wrote his autobiography, I Make My Own Rules, which was published in 1997.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Juggling his music and acting projects, LL Cool J released G.O.A.T. in 2000, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard chart. He then starred in the 2001 family drama, Kingdom Come, with Jada Pinkett Smith and Vivica A. Fox. Proving he was truly multi-talented, LL also authored a children's book, And the Winner Is, which was published in 2002. Still, he never abandoned his music. In 2003, he released 10, which featured a duet with Jennifer Lopez.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">LL continued to thrive as an actor, starring opposite Gabrielle Union in the 2003 romantic comedy Deliver Us From Eva. Taking on grittier fare, he also appeared in Michael Mann's big-budget action flick S.W.A.T (2003), with Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Farrell. He then took on the lead role in the 2005 crime drama Mindhunters, in which he played a FBI profiler-in-training.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around this time, LL Cool J continued to enjoy great musical success.

He co-authored the 2006 fitness book LL Cool J's Platinum Workout: Sculpt Your Best Body Ever with Hollywood's Fittest Star.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That year he starred with Queen Latifah in the romantic comedy Last Holiday, which made more than $38 million at the box office. LL also had a starring role in the 2007 independent crime thriller Slow Burn, with Ray Liotta.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2008, LL Cool J returned to music with Exit 13. "I'm not trying to be new school and I'm not old school. I'm classic," he said, in describing his latest release to Jet magazine. Tackling the small screen, LL landed a leading role on the criminal drama NCIS: Los Angeles, alongside Chris O'Donnell. A spinoff from the hit series NCIS, the show features O'Donnell and LL Cool J as Navy investigators out to solve military-related crimes on the West Coast. It was heralded as the most popular new drama of the 2009 fall television season.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Outside of music and acting, LL Cool J has explored many business opportunities.
