I can see that it’s my child but I can also see traits from the kidnapper in her. She would defend the kidnapper to me. She blames me for everything. I think she blames me that this woman is sitting in jail.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘She’s blocked now because I don’t want to argue with her. I’m tired of being hurt. I’m not saying there’s not a time that we can get closer but I really should not have to compete with that woman.’<span style=font-size:16px>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She even issued an ultimatum, insisting: ‘I shouldn’t have to compete with a kidnapper – she has to pick one of us.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It’s like a tug of war between us. Whenever I feel I’m winning her back, boom, the other side pulls me down,’ she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Nobody acknowledges my pain. I feel like I’m being robbed all over again every time she reaches out to my daughter.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Every phone call they share, every Mother’s Day card Kamiyah sends her, it just makes the pain worse. I’m being rejected for a kidnapper, how do you think that feels?’&nbsp;</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>‘It’s not like she tortured me!’ Florida teen snatched at birth and raised under a false identity pleads for leniency for her ‘mom’</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kamiyah Mobley issued an extraordinary plea for leniency before her mom’s trial, telling DailyMailTV: ‘It’s not like she tortured me.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The teen said that while she recognizes Williams could spend years behind bars, Kamiyah says she’s already forgiven her for the astonishing deception — and will never turn her back on the impostor.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Don’t get me wrong, I do feel like it was wrong. But we talked about it and I can understand at the time what was going on,’ Kamiyah, then aged 19, said in 2018. ‘I sympathize with her, I’m not mad at her — of course I forgive her.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I am certain that she’s going to get time but I’m hoping not very, very long. I think they should be lenient. It’s not like she took me and tortured me my whole life. She took care of me very well.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kamiyah has spent times forging new ties with her biological parents, as well as getting to know the numerous siblings she never realized she had.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She’s already formed an ‘incredible bond’ with Aiken, staying at his Jacksonville home for weeks at a time and celebrating Christmas with him, his wife Shannon, and her eight half-siblings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But he told DailyMailTV he doesn’t resent Kamiyah for refusing to sever ties with the woman who robbed him of the chance to cradle her as a baby or watch her growing up.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘She can’t help what happened with Gloria or the feelings she’s got for Gloria,’ said Aiken, a radio DJ and property manager.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘She just wants her mama to understand that she’s not trying to do anything to hurt her. The last thing she wants to do is hurt her mama.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘What I try and do is block out all the negativity and just focus on building that relationship with her. That helps me cope better too.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As thrilled as she was to meet her biological parents, there was never any likelihood that Alexis Manigo would slip effortlessly into Kamiyah Mobley’s shoes and leave her kidnapper languishing unloved and alone in a jail cell.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When Williams made her first court appearance on charges of first-degree kidnapping and third-degree custodial interference, Kamiyah was there, tearfully calling out to her before reaching through the metal bars to touch her fingers.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I know her and she’s not a criminal,’ she told DailyMailTV. ‘It was emotional seeing her behind bars and not being able to touch her and hug her, knowing she’s not coming home and I’m probably not going to see her for a very long time after that.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘To the world I was a victim but I’m too headstrong to personally call myself a victim. I do feel a crime was done but I don’t feel comfortable calling myself a victim.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘If she does end up going to prison for a long time I will never abandon her. We will always keep in touch.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kamiyah now splits her time between Aiken’s household and the house where she was raised, with friends and loved ones in Walterboro, South Carolina still referring to her as Alexis.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimkZ63or%2FUqZyrnpGjwG%2BvzqZmsKedlrtuw8eoZLCZo2LAtbvLnqVmnqKkum7Ax55koaejpba1rctmmKxlkWK7psPBqKmnZZGjsW6%2BwKKqnpxdl8ZutMSrZKShlKOusbzEq2SbnZeoeqe70WaknqqTrnw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-to-pronounce-caprice.html>&#171;&nbsp;How to pronounce caprice</a>
