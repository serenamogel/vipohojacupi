"This is Holly Golightly's black sheath and pearls.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It inspired real fashion to use flowers as accessories," added Rubenstein.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We loved the rest of the outfit, too — hello, Dior saddle bag!&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This is a beautiful Americana-tailored look; it's very Grace Kelly.
