He had three children: twins Gregory and Matthew Romano, as well as Joseph Raymond Romano.</p><p>The 64-year-old actor once claimed he always found a way to immerse himself with his children, unlike his on-screen character in the CBS sitcom.</p><p>“Ray Barone’s kids aren’t often seen on TV. I spend a lot more time with my kids.</p><p>In an interview with Parents magazine in October 2005, Ray made this claim.</p><h2><span id=Marriage_and_Family_Relationships_in_the_Ray_Romano_Family>Marriage and Family Relationships in the Ray Romano Family</span></h2><p>The Emmy Award-winning actor spoke candidly about his marriage to Anna and their four children during the same exchange. He acknowledged the love and support of his family for his job, especially the delight of his children in hearing him voice an Ice Age character.</p><p>Back in the day, Ray would create fictionalized accounts of his family’s real-life events for his films and TV shows. In addition, he used his juniors as extras in a number of his projects. Even now, he and his family are happy to share a home, but they choose to stay out of the public eye.</p><p>According to reports, Ray spent the turbulent pandemic period with his wife and children who are now adults. In a 2020 interview with People, the actor discussed the benefits and drawbacks of staying at home with his family during a pandemic.</p><p>However, he didn’t mind visiting his wife and kids at their home and loving on them.</p><p>“We already have the 22-year-old here. We also have twins who reside a short distance away in their apartment. So they came back. Additionally, my daughter owns a house in Venice, California. She’ll stay here for a week before going back home.</p><p>It’s rather enjoyable. They are adults nonetheless. I am so sorry for the people who are keeping little children in quarantine.</p><h2><span id=What_Are_Ray_Romano8217s_Kids_Doing_These_Days>What Are Ray Romano’s Kids Doing These Days?</span></h2><p>The offspring of Ray and Anna have made names for themselves in a variety of fields. The couple’s oldest child, Alexandra, seems to have chosen a career in acting like her father. Her performance in the 2012 film Ice Age: Continental Drift earned her widespread recognition.</p><p>She has been employed by Shondaland in Hollywood as a marketing and communications manager since May 2017. His twin brothers Gregory and Matthew also work in the industry. Gregory reportedly served as a production assistant on The Late Show With James Corden, according to Closer Weekly. On Jimmy Kimmel Live, Matthew also serves as a production assistant.</p><p>The youngest son, Joseph, hasn’t achieved much success yet, but in 2009’s Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, he made his voice-acting debut.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Wife, Girlfriend, And Family Of Adam G.
