The candidate took many standard Republican positions on taxes, the economy, and fighting terrorism, while consistently and vocally criticizing incumbent President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/barack-obama data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Barack Obama" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Barack Obama</a>, a Democrat.

He showed more mainstream Republican appeal than Tea Party–backed competitors like Texas Governor <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/rick-perry data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rick Perry" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rick Perry</a>. In January 2012, Romney scored a decisive victory in the New Hampshire Republican primary by capturing more than 39 percent of votes. As the race continued, Rick Santorum became his greatest competition, winning several states. However, Romney secured a substantial lead in the number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In April 2012, Romney benefited from a narrowing of the field when Santorum announced that he was suspending his campaign. That left only Ron Paul and Newt Gingrich as Republican competitors, with Gingrich soon throwing in the towel as well.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Romney’s campaign met with negative publicity in July 2012, when President Obama’s campaign ran ads claiming that his opponent was the head of Bain Capital until 2001, not 1999 as was previously stated. Around that same time, news reports began to circulate regarding economy-stifling practices by Bain Capital; according to the reports, Romney’s company had invested in several businesses that specialized in relocating jobs overseas.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Romney’s campaign fired back with its own political ads, which claimed that Obama was more interested in helping his donors than looking out for the American public. This was only the beginning of the slinging of barbs and arrows that would occur between the two candidates along the campaign trail.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In mid-August 2012, Romney announced 42-year-old U.S. Representative <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/paul-ryan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Paul Ryan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Paul Ryan</a> of Wisconsin as his running mate for vice president. The fiscal conservative was chair of the House of Representatives Budget Committee. Weeks later on August 28, Romney became the Republican Party’s official presidential nominee, receiving 2,061 delegate votes—nearly double the required 1,144—at the 2012 Republican National Convention, held in Tampa, Florida.</p><img alt="mitt romney and barack obama, both wearing black suits and ties, speak simultaneously into microphones on a stage during a debate" title="Mitt Romney and then-President Barack Obama at a presidential debate in October 2012" width=3121 height=2169 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/republican-presidential-candidate-mitt-romney-and-u-s-news-photo-1694705744.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Mitt Romney and Barack Obama debate in a town hall–style format at Hofstra University on October 16, 2012.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Romney made headlines after his first presidential debate with Obama in early October 2012. He gave a strong performance, receiving praise for his speaking skills from citizens and critics alike. Most agreed that Romney won the debate and that his performance significantly boosted his public perception and status in the presidential race. However, Obama was praised for his performance during the second and third debates, with many people claiming that the president had won both.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As each state announced its election results on November 6, 2012, many Americans clung to the edge of their seats. Just before midnight, the results were announced: In a tight race, Obama defeated Romney, with the president receiving just over half of the popular vote and around 60 percent of the electoral vote.</p><h2 data-node-id=37 title="Leading Republican Voice Not in Office " data-anchor-id=leading-republican-voice-not-in-office class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Leading Republican Voice Not in Office</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Romney retreated from the public eye following his draining 2012 presidential campaign and defeat. He rejoined the board of directors of Marriott International and became executive partner group chairman of Solamere Capital, occasionally surfacing for interviews.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By 2014, the former presidential nominee was back in the game, throwing his weight behind various Republican candidates ahead of the midterm elections. His presence fueled rumors that a third run for president was coming, but after reportedly considering the possibility, Romney in early 2015 announced that he wouldn’t do so.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Nevertheless, Romney remained involved in the public conversation as the campaign season heated up.

The president-elect seemed willing to put their conflict behind him, reportedly considering Romney for secretary of state, before nominating <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/rex-tillerson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rex Tillerson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rex Tillerson</a> for the role instead.

Around this time, news broke that the former Massachusetts governor had been treated for prostate cancer the previous summer.

He was one of only two Republican senators (along with Maine’s Susan Collins) to vote to allow witnesses during the Senate trial, and the only member of the GOP to vote to convict the president on one of the two impeachment charges, for abuse of power.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Utah senator was present during the attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters on January 6, 2021, in an attempt to stop a joint session of Congress from certifying the Electoral College votes following <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/joe-biden data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Joe Biden" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Joe Biden</a>’s defeat of Trump in the 2020 presidential election.
