Their oath, as posted on the wall of <a href=# title="Team Rocket HQ">one</a> of their many bases, is "Steal Pokémon for profit. Exploit Pokémon for profit. All Pokémon exist for the glory of Team Rocket." Their ultimate goal is to take over the world using Pokémon.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=In_the_core_series_games>In the core series games</span></h2><h3><span class=mw-headline id=In_Kanto>In Kanto</span></h3><p>In the <a href=# title="Generation I">Generation I</a> games and <a href=# title="Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions">their remakes</a>, Team Rocket's attention is focused in their home region of Kanto, distributing Pokémon as prizes through the <a href=# title="Celadon Game Corner">Rocket Game Corner</a> in <a href=# title="Celadon City">Celadon City</a> and the <a href=# title="Team Rocket Hideout">secret subterranean hideout</a> underneath it. In <a href=# title="Mt. Moon">Mt. Moon</a>, one of the many grunts says that Team Rocket intends to sell the <a href=# title=Fossil>Pokémon Fossils</a> they are mining in the cave, while another describes the group as <b>Pokémon gangsters</b> (Japanese: <b><span lang=ja>ポケモンマフィア</span></b> <i>Pokémon Mafia</i>). Several members also broke into a house in <a href=# title="Cerulean City">Cerulean City</a> to steal a TM from its owner, and a mission devoted to stealing <a href=# title="Cubone (Pokémon)">Cubone</a> skulls in <a href=# title="Lavender Town">Lavender Town</a> resulted in a hostage situation involving <a href=# title="Mr. Fuji">Mr. Fuji</a> and the death of a <a href=# title="Marowak (Pokémon)">Marowak</a>. Another hostage situation developed soon afterward when the organization overran <a href=# title="Silph Co.">Silph Co.</a> in <a href=# title="Saffron City">Saffron City</a> with the intention of getting the plans for the <a href=# title="Master Ball">Master Ball</a>, a prototype of which had already been produced. A Team Rocket recruiter runs the <a href=# title="Kanto Route 24">Nugget Bridge</a> challenge north of Cerulean, and asks the player to join the Team when the challenge is completed.</p><p>The <a href=# title="Player character">player</a> is tasked with ousting the organization from its strongholds, and doing so, will meet the Team Rocket Boss, <a href=# title=Giovanni>Giovanni</a>. He is adamant about the success of his plots, but is not heard from again after his appearance at Silph until the player returns to <a href=# title="Viridian City">Viridian City</a> for their final Badge—which Giovanni himself is in charge of giving out, being the region's eighth, <a href=# title="Ground (type)">Ground</a>-specialist Gym Leader. After the player has defeated him this final time, Giovanni acknowledges the player as a better Trainer and disappears without a trace, vowing to disband Team Rocket (though it is later revealed in Generation IV that he only intended to become stronger, and he deliberately didn't completely disband Team Rocket).</p><p>Three years later, one Team Rocket operative returned to Kanto to steal a critical part from its <a href=# title="Kanto Power Plant">Power Plant</a>. Since only this member was involved in this plot, it is likely that he had no knowledge of Team Rocket's prior second disbandment and was working independently. Curiously enough, in <a href=# title="Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver Versions">HeartGold and SoulSilver</a>, he mentions that he will return to his home country and rebuild Team Rocket anew, something that he did not say in <a href=# title="Pokémon Gold and Silver Versions">the original games</a>, though it is later revealed in <a href=# title="Pokémon Black and White Versions">Black and White</a> that he gave up his plans when he returned <a href=# title="Icirrus City">home</a> and subsequently married, instead finding happiness with his new family. Team Rocket has not been seen since.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=In_the_Sevii_Islands>In the Sevii Islands</span></h3><p>In FireRed and LeafGreen, Team Rocket has a small branch in the <a href=# title="Sevii Islands">Sevii Islands</a>, searching for the <a href=# title="Ruby (item)">Ruby</a> and <a href=# title="Sapphire (item)">Sapphire</a> gems. This branch is based out of the <a href=# title="Rocket Warehouse">Rocket Warehouse</a> on <a href=# title="Five Island">Five Island</a>, situated in the middle of the <a href=# title="Five Isle Meadow">Five Isle Meadow</a>, where many Pokémon are held captive in cages.</p><p>Their search for the Ruby leads them to <a href=# title="Mt. Ember">Mt. Ember</a>, though they fail to find it. They then appear in <a href=# title="Icefall Cave">Icefall Cave</a> where, with the help of <a href=# title=Lorelei>Lorelei</a>, they are driven out. A scientist named <a href=# title=Gideon>Gideon</a> then appears at the <a href=# title="Dotted Hole">Dotted Hole</a> to retrieve the Sapphire.</p><p>The player must then follow Gideon to their Rocket Warehouse where the Sapphire must be retrieved. After the player defeats the two Admins at the Rocket Warehouse, they realize that Giovanni has been defeated in Kanto, and without the lifeblood of the organization, all is lost for the Sevii Islands branch. Team Rocket subsequently pulled out of the Sevii Islands and has not been seen there since.</p><p>It is highly likely that this branch may be the precursor to the <a href=# title=Johto>Johto</a> branch that will appear <a href=# title="Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver Versions">three years later</a> from this time, as one of the computer screens has plans for a device to force Pokémon to evolve. Such a device will cause a rampage of Gyarados at the <a href=# title="Lake of Rage">Lake of Rage</a> during the plot of HeartGold and SoulSilver. In addition, the Rocket members here vow to find Giovanni and rebuild Team Rocket, which will be the goal of Team Rocket during the Generation II games and their remakes. The Rocket Admins, considering their teams, may in fact be <a href=# title=Ariana>Ariana</a> and <a href=# title=Archer>Archer</a>. However, the presence of an office used by Giovanni in the Mahogany Town base suggests that Team Rocket may have established the Johto branch before Giovanni initially disbanded the group.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=In_Johto>In Johto</span></h3><p>In the <a href=# title="Generation II">Generation II</a> games and <a href=# title="Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver Versions">their remakes</a>, three years after the defeat of Giovanni at the hands of <a href=# title="Red (game)">Red</a>, a few members of the old Team Rocket attempted to reestablish the organization and get it back in operation, while awaiting the return of <a href=# title=Giovanni>their leader</a>, who was apparently away on solo training. The Generation II iteration of the <a href=# title="Team Rocket HQ">Team Rocket HQ</a> also features a <b>Team Rocket Oath</b> (Japanese: <b><span lang=ja>ロケットだんこころえ</span></b> <i>Rocket Gang Motto</i>), which states that Pokémon exist for the glory of Team Rocket and should be stolen and exploited for profit.</p><p>This new Team Rocket started off small, first kidnapping the <a href=# title="Slowpoke (Pokémon)">Slowpoke</a> from <a href=# title="Azalea Town">Azalea Town</a> and holding them hostage to create rain, while selling their <a href=# title="Slowpoke Tail">tails</a> to the black market to help reform Team Rocket. They began their operation, led by Executive <a href=# title=Proton>Proton</a>, in the <a href=# title="Slowpoke Well">Slowpoke Well</a>, where all of the local Slowpoke dwelled. However, with the help of <a href=# title=Kurt>Kurt</a>, the player manages to scare them away, and return the Slowpoke back to the town. When the player enters Goldenrod City, a Rocket is seen outside the <a href=# title="Goldenrod Radio Tower">Radio Tower</a>. In Generation IV in Ecruteak City, the player encounters a Rocket Grunt harassing a <a href=# title="Kimono Girl">Kimono Girl</a>, and the player must defeat him. Eventually, they are encountered in <a href=# title="Mahogany Town">Mahogany Town</a>, where they have set up a <a href=# title="Team Rocket HQ">secret hideout</a> in the basement of the town's shop, which stores a machine that emits high-frequency sound waves. These sound waves brainwash Pokémon and induce evolution in the <a href=# title="Magikarp (Pokémon)">Magikarp</a> that live in the <a href=# title="Lake of Rage">Lake of Rage</a> north of the town, turning them into <a href=# title="Gyarados (Pokémon)">Gyarados</a>, which are far more profitable than their pre-evolutionary form. With the help of the <a href=# title="Indigo Plateau">Indigo Plateau</a> <a href=# title="Pokémon Champion">Champion</a>, <a href=# title=Lance>Lance</a>, the player defeats the syndicate once again. In this mission, the player must defeat Executives <a href=# title=Petrel>Petrel</a> and <a href=# title=Ariana>Ariana</a>.</p><p>In a last-ditch attempt to get in contact with their former leader, Giovanni, the group hijacks the <a href=# title="Goldenrod Radio Tower">Radio Tower</a> in <a href=# title="Goldenrod City">Goldenrod City</a>, flooding the airwaves with a message to Giovanni. <a href=# title=Petrel>Petrel</a>, who disguised himself as the impostor station manager, met with the player, who challenged the Rocket Executive to a battle, and in the process, admitting the location of where they were holding the real station manager to the player, the Goldenrod Underground. Thus, with the real station manager free of Team Rocket's hold, the player rushes off to meet <a href=# title=Archer>Archer</a>, the interim head of Team Rocket, where they face off in a final match. Once again defeated by the main protagonist, the Executives in charge of the operation vow to disband Team Rocket for good. Every Rocket Executive is fought in this mission. Likewise, several miles away, in <a href=# title="Tohjo Falls">Tohjo Falls</a>, Giovanni heard the message, intending to use it as his return, until he was defeated by the player and <a href=# title="Ethan (game)">Ethan</a>/<a href=# title="Lyra (game)">Lyra</a>, who had traveled back in time with <a href=# title="Celebi (Pokémon)">Celebi</a>.</p><p>The Team Rocket members involved in the Johto plot may be connected in some way to the Sevii Islands branch of Team Rocket, as the Executives have similar teams to the Executives there, while a computer in the <a href=# title="Rocket Warehouse">Rocket Warehouse</a> indicates the beginnings of the Lake of Rage plot.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=In_Unova>In Unova</span></h3><p>Although Team Rocket itself does not appear in <a href=# title="Generation V">Generation V</a>, it was implied that the Team Rocket operative in Cerulean City planned to re-establish Team Rocket in Unova, but he gave up on those plans when he married. He resides in <a href=# title="Icirrus City">Icirrus City</a> with his wife and son. Team Rocket is also mentioned by a <a href=# title="Team Plasma Grunt (Trainer class)">Team Plasma Grunt</a> in <a href=# title="N's Castle">N's Castle</a> in the first games, who claims that their plans were thwarted because "they drew too much attention to themselves".</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=In_Alola>In Alola</span></h3><i>Main article: <a href=# title="Team Rainbow Rocket">Team Rainbow Rocket</a></i><p>In <a href=# title="Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon">Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon</a>, an <a href=# title="Pokémon multiverse">alternate universe</a> version of Team Rocket where they succeeded in their plan to take over the world, now called Team Rainbow Rocket, appears in <a href=# title=Alola>Alola</a>.

A variation of this logo with a circular symbol behind the insignia was introduced in <i><a href=# title=XY107>An Explosive Operation!</a></i>, subsequently being utilized in Giovanni's office. Since <i><a href=# title="Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon">Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon</a></i>, the logo is flat.

After following him through Kanto, the <a href=# title="Orange Archipelago">Orange Islands</a>, and Johto, coming in contact with many other Team Rocket members along the way and being shown as incompetent compared to said members, the trio followed Ash to the <a href=# title=Hoenn>Hoenn</a> region under directions from Giovanni to establish a branch of Team Rocket there (though this was really only a ploy to get them out of his hair). When Ash returned from Hoenn after competing in its <a href=# title="Ever Grande Conference">regional League Conference</a>, the trio returned to Kanto as well, empty-handed. After following him through Kanto once again, Giovanni assigned the trio to the <a href=# title=Sinnoh>Sinnoh</a> region, again with the directive to establish a Team Rocket branch there.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/3/39/Team_Rocket_BW_1.png/375px-Team_Rocket_BW_1.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>Giovanni claimed before to not even recognize the three agents. Meowth often <a href=# title="Boss fantasy">fantasizes</a> about pleasing Giovanni with Pokémon captured using one of the trio's many harebrained schemes and mechas, at which point he would then replace <a href=# title="Giovanni's Persian">Giovanni's Persian</a> as "top cat", however this is hindered by both the fact that Ash and <a href=# title="Ash's friends">his friends</a> defeat the trio each time, and formerly Giovanni's low opinion of the three as well, who have managed to eat up much of Team Rocket's funding with their failures.</p><p>While Giovanni viewed the trio as "bumbling idiots who can't do anything right", they have occasionally shown that they can do things right, if only by working on the side of Ash and his friends. It should be noted that when other Team Rocket members have come into contact with Ash or any of his friends they've been often just as easily foiled as these three.</p><p>The trio has often been shown as poor or having little money. This may be due to the amount of machinery and costumes they use in their attempts to capture Ash's Pikachu. They often take on side-jobs like selling food at stadiums or creating fake items and selling them to the public. Several episodes after the series began, they notably started speaking in rhymes from time to time.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title="Pokémon the Series: Black & White">Pokémon the Series: Black & White</a></i>, the trio stopped being the anime's comedic relief, accomplishing several missions assigned to them and also receiving new uniforms. They have also become more of a threat to Ash and his friends. Multiple agents were also situated in <a href=# title=Unova>Unova</a>, who passed on information and orders to Jessie, James, and Meowth. Giovanni himself has also been featured much more prominently, regularly assigning the trio missions and passing on information. Eventually returning to their old costumes, but retaining their serious tone and weaponry, they acted under <a href=# title="Dr. Zager">Dr. Zager</a> to accomplish further missions.</p><p>Giovanni later returned to lead the trio in one last mission, Operation Tempest, in <i><a href=# title=BW096>Meloetta and the Undersea Temple!</a></i> and <i><a href=# title=BW097>Unova's Survival Crisis!</a></i>. Following its failure, Giovanni retreated with the trio to Kanto, but the trio later returned in <i><a href=# title=BW109>New Places, Familiar Faces!</a></i>. At first returning to their original goal of capturing Pikachu, they later came into conflict with <a href=# title="Team Plasma">Team Plasma</a> and eventually aided Ash and <a href=# title=Looker>Looker</a> in defeating <a href=# title=Ghetsis>Ghetsis</a>.</p><p>The trio returned fully to their previous role as comic relief in the <i>Decolora Adventure!</i> arc, roles they continued to retain during <i><a href=# title="Pokémon the Series: XY">Pokémon the Series: XY</a></i> and <i><a href=# title="Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon">Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon</a></i>, but they still had advanced technology until the end of <i>XY</i>. <a href=# title="Jessie's Wobbuffet">Jessie's Wobbuffet</a> rejoined them in <i><a href=# title=BW142>The Dream Continues!</a></i>, at the end of the <i>Decolora Adventure!</i> arc, and accompanied them to <a href=# title=Kalos>Kalos</a> in <i>XY</i> and <a href=# title=Alola>Alola</a> in <i>Sun & Moon</i> as an effective fourth member of the group to steal rare Pokémon from those regions. Despite once again being comic relief, Jessie and James seem to have become much better at battling, immediately posing a challenge to Ash and his friends several times. Giovanni also continued to support them; he no longer admonished them for their failures and relied on them to accomplish Team Rocket's work in Kalos and Alola. However, Team Rocket had no presence in Kalos and Alola other than Jessie, James, Meowth, and Wobbuffet. Starting in <i><a href=# title=SM004>First Catch in Alola, Ketchum-Style!</a></i>, they have lived in a <a href=# title="Bewear (anime)">Bewear</a>'s den on Alola's <a href=# title="Melemele Island">Melemele Island</a>.

After they realized they made the mistake, Team Rocket dumped the bag and went to Elm's lab, ending Gold and Silver's (who Gold thought was the culprit) battle by knocking out Gold with an Elekid. Silver then took them on and defeated all of the Rocket Grunts and they all disappeared by the time Gold regained consciousness.</p><p>They appeared once again at the <a href=# title="Ruins of Alph">Ruins of Alph</a>, searching for the Unown when they encountered Bugsy and Gold. Gold had his Sunbo use flash to blind them which in turn, had the Unown which they all thought were simply symbols on the wall come out and attack them. Team Rocket then had their <a href=# title="Spinarak (Pokémon)">Spinarak</a> use Spider Web to trap Gold and Bugsy in a room, but Gold had <a href=# title=Exbo>Exbo</a> use SmokeScreen so some Unown would get caught in the web and take out their anger on Team Rocket.

They are <a href=# title="Giovanni (Adventures)">Giovanni</a>'s new lieutenants and are quite powerful and ruthless. They are individually known as <a href=# title=Carr>Carr</a>, <a href=# title=Orm>Orm</a>, and <a href=# title=Sird>Sird</a>.</p><p>Under Giovanni's command, they raid the <a href=# title="Sevii Islands">Sevii Islands</a> looking for Red, Green and Blue. It seems this was done to obtain data on <a href=# title="Deoxys (Adventures)">Deoxys</a>. After Giovanni captured Deoxys, they headed back to Kanto. Both Carr and Orm have used a black <a href=# title=Pokédex>Pokédex</a>, which are used to determine their opponents' <a href=# title=Stat>Attack stat</a> and <a href=# title=Level>level</a>.</p><p>At the end of the chapter, Carr was led to believe that Giovanni was going to pass on the leadership of Team Rocket to Silver. He attempted to overthrow the other Three Beasts members, as well as Giovanni. Orm was thrown off the <a href=# title="Team Rocket airship">Team Rocket airship</a>, with his whereabouts currently unknown, and Carr attempted to kill Sird, Red, Giovanni, and the others aboard the airship.</p><p>Sird, however, survived, and attempted to recapture Deoxys.

However, he is quickly stopped by the <b>Rocket Executives</b>, being led by <a href=# title=Archer>Archer</a> and his comrades, <a href=# title=Ariana>Ariana</a>, <a href=# title=Proton>Proton</a>, and <a href=# title=Petrel>Petrel</a>. The four executives reveal their goal which is to find Giovanni and have him be the rightful ruler of Team Rocket once again.</p><p>The goal of the executives was to collect all the Plates in order to summon <a href=# title="Arceus (Adventures)">Arceus</a> and bring back Giovanni with its power. Each of the executives had their own role in the mission: Petrel to find all the Plates, Proton to locate the <a href=# title="Sinjoh Ruins">Sinjoh Ruins</a>, Ariana to ward off all intruders, and Archer to find Arceus. Petrel initially had three of the sixteen Plates but they were stolen by Silver. Ariana battled Crystal and nearly won but the battle was interrupted by Arceus.</p><p>Eventually, Silver collected all sixteen Plates and the three Dexholders are warped to the Sinjoh Ruins along with Arceus and the executives. There, Archer has control of Arceus due to him being in possession of the Plates and he cries out to Giovanni. Archer forces Arceus to create the <a href=# title="Pokémon of Myth">Pokémon of Myth</a>. Silver is shocked by the mention of Giovanni's name and Petrel reveals to Silver that he knows that Silver is the son of their boss. He attacks Silver and reveals that he intends to betray his teammates so he can be second-in-command of Team Rocket. Silver attempts to distract the Executives by sacrificing himself and Gold and Crystal uses that opportunity to use the Ultimate Moves to destroy the Pokémon of Myth. Arceus regains control of itself and uses its powers to send the Executives flying.</p><p>However, the creation process cannot be stopped and so Arceus succeeds in creating the Pokémon of Myth. Archer starts to lose his sanity and claims that all Arceus creates belongs to Team Rocket. Archer's behavior starts to scare his teammates and Petrel attempts to escape by disguising as Giovanni. However, he is stopped by the real Giovanni himself.</p><p>At first, Archer is delighted to see that the real Giovanni has returned. However, Giovanni, knowing that Archer's plans may potentially destroy the world, tries to stop the Pokémon of Myth with the returned Lance and Pryce. Archer is horrified by this and deems Giovanni as no longer the man and leader he thought he was. Archer, having lost his mind, runs at Arceus but is simply knocked back and lands on top of Petrel. The other executives remain hiding behind rocks, watching the battle.</p><p>After Gold manages to calm Arceus down by successfully connecting with his Pokémon, Petrel attempts to escape by disguising as Bugsy. He is spotted by Gold and is stopped by Lance. When Gold asks Lance how he was defeated by a coward by Petrel, Lance explains that Petrel managed to stun him by disguising as <a href=# title="Yellow (Adventures)">a Trainer with the same powers and birthplace as him</a>.</p><p>After having stopped the Pokémon of Myth, Giovanni is visibly exhausted due to his disease. However, the Team Rocket Elite Trio managed to obtain the herbs needed to cure Giovanni's disease with the help of Gold's <a href=# title=Pibu>Pichu</a>, the <a href=# title="Spiky-eared Pichu">Spiky-eared Pichu</a>, and <a href=# title="Celebi (Adventures)">Celebi</a>. After being cured, Giovanni decides to lead Team Rocket once again. He offers Silver a position in the team but Silver declines, stating that he shall stop Giovanni one day. Giovanni accepts his son's decision and walks away with the other Rocket members. Archer is carried off by a female grunt from the crowd and Giovanni states that he shall meet his punishment soon.</p><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody><tr><th><a href=# class=image title=201><img alt=201 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/c/c4/Ani201ODEX.png decoding=async width=32 height=32 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></th><th>Spoilers end here.</th><th><a href=# class=image title=201><img alt=201 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/c/c4/Ani201ODEX.png decoding=async width=32 height=32 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></th></tr></tbody></table><h3><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_Gold_.26_Silver:_The_Golden_Boys></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_Gold_&_Silver:_The_Golden_Boys>Pokémon Gold & Silver: The Golden Boys</span></h3><table align=center><tbody readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td width=50px align=center><a href=# class=image><img alt=050Diglett.png src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/a6/0050Diglett.png/75px-0050Diglett.png decoding=async width=50 height=50 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td><td><b>This section is incomplete.</b><br>Please feel free to edit this section to add missing information and complete it.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Team Rocket appears in this manga.</p><h3><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_Zensho></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_Zensho>Pokémon Zensho</span></h3><table align=center><tbody readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td width=50px align=center><a href=# class=image><img alt=050Diglett.png src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/a6/0050Diglett.png/75px-0050Diglett.png decoding=async width=50 height=50 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td><td><b>This section is incomplete.</b><br>Please feel free to edit this section to add missing information and complete it.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Team Rocket appears in this manga.</p><h3><span id=Pocket_Monsters_HGSS_J.C5.8D.27s_Big_Adventure></span><span class=mw-headline id="Pocket_Monsters_HGSS_Jō's_Big_Adventure">Pocket Monsters HGSS Jō's Big Adventure</span></h3><table align=center><tbody readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td width=50px align=center><a href=# class=image><img alt=050Diglett.png src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/a6/0050Diglett.png/75px-0050Diglett.png decoding=async width=50 height=50 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td><td><b>This section is incomplete.</b><br>Please feel free to edit this section to add missing information and complete it.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Team Rocket appears in this manga.</p><h3><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_Pocket_Monsters></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_Pocket_Monsters>Pokémon Pocket Monsters</span></h3><table align=center><tbody readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td width=50px align=center><a href=# class=image><img alt=050Diglett.png src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/a6/0050Diglett.png/75px-0050Diglett.png decoding=async width=50 height=50 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td><td><b>This section is incomplete.</b><br>Please feel free to edit this section to add missing information and complete it.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><a href=# title="Giovanni (Pocket Monsters)">Giovanni</a> is the leader of Team Rocket.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=In_other_media>In other media</span></h2><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/ad/Sakaki_Saburo.png/375px-Sakaki_Saburo.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Sakaki Saburo<h3><span class=mw-headline id=Pack_Your_Pocket_With_Adventure>Pack Your Pocket With Adventure</span></h3><p>In <a href=# title=PPA08>PPA08</a>, a company called <i><b>Cosmetics Rocket</b></i> was introduced, as was one of their marketing team members called <a href=# title="Saburō Sakaki">Saburō Sakaki</a>, who is heavily inspired in <a href=# title=Giovanni>Giovanni</a>.
