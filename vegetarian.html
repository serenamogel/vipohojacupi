I love it because it‚Äôs fun, fresh, filling, and healthy, and it‚Äôs also a great way to use up odds and ends of ingredients I have leftover from recipe testing (or, you know, just making dinner) during the week. That half bunch of cilantro? Gone. The last little bit of cabbage? In it goes! Random black beans or avocado?

Not that we‚Äôre big sports fans, but I&nbsp;am a big fan of any day where it‚Äôs perfectly acceptable to eat all of the spicy, salsa-smothered, avocado-filled foods that I crave. So I‚Äôm sharing my healthier versions of traditional party favorites that don‚Äôt sacrifice in flavor because, well, foods like avocados, black beans, spicy peppers, and fresh salsa just taste good and are good for you!

Green smoothies, fresh bowls of vegetables, and hearty stews are all over social media. There‚Äôs not a cookie in sight and we don‚Äôt care because gorgeous healthy food is in abundance.

I don‚Äôt like to feel hungry or deprived so instead I turn to&nbsp;recipes like these, a collection of my personal favorite&nbsp;plant-forward recipes that are both delicious and satisfying.
