Apart from that, James’s brief professional career has seen him as a contentious athlete. He has been in the public eye due to these troubles and has been detained multiple times.</p><p>The basketball player, nevertheless, doesn’t talk much about his romantic life or relationships. Born on September 18, 2000, James David Bouknight is a professional basketball player who became well-known while he was a member of the National Basketball Association’s Charlotte Hornets.</p><p>In a similar vein, the basketball player improved while he was a member of the UConn Huskies. He was chosen by the Hornets with the eleventh pick in the NBA draft of 2021, and on August 3, 2021, he became a member of the team. The basketball star, who stands 6 feet 4 inches tall, entered the NBA on October 22, 2021, and on November 26 of that same year, he scored his first basket.</p><p>With a career-high 24 points on December 10, James had his best game. The controversial basketball player changed his uniform number from 5 to 2 before the 2022–2023 season. Sadly, on February 8, 2024, he was fired by the Hornets, bringing a sudden end to his time with the team.</p><h2>James Bouknight Wife</h2><p>At the moment, James Bouknight is unmarried. He hasn’t brought up his marriage or shown off a person who resembles his wife. Furthermore, there is no evidence of the rising basketball player with a woman who appears to be his girlfriend. His engagement and wedding plans were kept a secret until this article was published.</p><p>The sportsman doesn’t appear to be interested in dating at this moment; instead, he appears to be fully focused on his developing career. The basketball player is still in the early phases of his career, so it appears that his entire focus and dedication are currently focused on it.</p><p>His career is already in jeopardy due to numerous issues, therefore he might not have time to think about dating. In the upcoming days, he might find the ideal match for himself. Moreover, there is no evidence to substantiate his past dating or relationship history.</p><p>He might or might not have had a previous relationship. James also enjoys close relationships with his teammates, friends, and family. Up until now, he has never been involved in a romantic conflict.</p><h2>Personal Life and Controversies</h2><p>In his early career, James, an NBA player, has already faced several problems and legal difficulties. Yes, his irresponsible driving has resulted in several arrests. The American basketball player was arrested by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police on October 16, 2022, at approximately 1:51 a.m. for driving under the influence.</p><p>He was found unconscious in a parking garage around 12:44 in the morning. The young athlete had a Glock 23, a bag of Doritos, and a 40-caliber handgun when he was apprehended. After his bond was subsequently set at $2,500, the athlete resumed exercising the next day.</p><p>This was not James’ first run-in with the law while driving; he had previously been arrested for speeding and reckless driving. His legal troubles and conflicts take precedence over his romantic life for all of these reasons.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Basketball Player</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Trending News</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Jennifer Misner | Husband And Married Life</a></h3>Dustin Diamond's ex-wife is Jennifer Misner, a late actor.
